The NetLogo code for our work is "Wound infection model add cytokine.nlogo", where we added the simulation of cytokines to the initial model. 
Most of the changes can be found in the "Run-simulation" section, we also added some comments to the code to help explain our ideas.

We also added three Excel files to the repository, they are "Initial", "Normal", and "Stimulated". These are not the data directly exported from the NetLogo world, 
we only kept the number of bacteria, neutrophils, macrophages, and debris in these files for plotting in MATLAB.

The MATLAB script "project_plot.m" is the code we used to plot the figures we put in the abstract.
